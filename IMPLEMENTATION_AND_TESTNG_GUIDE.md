# Employee API Implementation Summary

## Core Implementation
- **7 REST endpoints** implementing the IEmployeeController interface
- **Spring Boot application** with service layer architecture
- **Caffeine caching** with 5-minute TTL for performance optimization
- **Retry mechanism** with exponential backoff for resilience

## Key Features
- **Error handling**: Custom exceptions with global exception handler
- **Validation**: Bean validation with detailed error messages  
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries for 429/5xx errors (max 8 attempts)
- **Caching**: Intelligent cache eviction on data modifications
- **Logging**: Comprehensive debug logging for all operations

## Retry Logic in Action
The retry mechanism handles rate limiting (429) and server errors (5xx) with exponential backoff:

```
Configuration: delay=2000ms, multiplier=2, maxDelay=20000ms, maxAttempts=8

Real execution example from integration tests:
16:49:09.859 - Retry: count=4 for deleteEmployeeById
16:49:09.863 - Response 429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS (rate limited)
16:49:09.863 - Sleeping for 20000ms (20 seconds - maxDelay reached)
16:49:29.868 - Retry: count=5 for deleteEmployeeById  
16:49:29.873 - Response 200 OK (SUCCESS after retry)
```

**Timeline**: 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 20s → 20s → 20s → 20s (capped at maxDelay)
**Result**: Gracefully handles 30-90 second rate limiting windows

## Testing
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 89 unit tests with 94% line coverage
- **Full test suite**: Happy path, error scenarios, validation, retry behavior
- **Mock server integration** for end-to-end testing
- **Coverage exceeds requirements**: 94% instruction coverage (>90% target)

## Running Tests

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: No servers needed (mocked dependencies)
- **EmployeeWithMockServerIntegrationTest**: Requires mock server UP

### Quick Testing (No Servers Required)
```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew api:test
```

### Complete Testing (One-Stop Solution)
```bash
# Automatically starts mock server, runs ALL tests with coverage, stops server
./test-with-mock-server.sh
```

### Manual Testing Setup
```bash
# 1. Start mock server (required for WithMockServerIntegrationTest)
./gradlew server:bootRun

# 2. Run tests that need live server
./gradlew -Dmock.server.running=true api:test --tests "*WithMockServerIntegrationTest"

# 3. Start API for manual testing (port 8111)
./gradlew api:bootRun
```

## Manual API Testing
Start both servers, then test endpoints:
```bash
# Get all employees
curl -s http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee | jq

# Create employee
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Soumadipta Roy", "salary": 75000, "age": 35, "title": "Developer"}' | jq

# Get by ID (use ID from create response)
curl -s http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee/{EMPLOYEE_ID} | jq

# Search by name
curl -s http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee/search/Soumadipta | jq

# Get highest salary
curl -s http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee/highestSalary

# Get top earners
curl -s http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee/topTenHighestEarningEmployeeNames | jq

# Delete employee
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:8111/api/v1/employee/{EMPLOYEE_ID}
```
